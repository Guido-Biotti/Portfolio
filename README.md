# Let me tell you a bit about me and data

I first knew about data when I found the Google Data Analytics Course in Coursera. I didn't know anything about it at that time but I loved it. Since then I've been learning and practicing a lot with it to become a great data analyst. And maybe someday even a data scientist.

What i liked (and I still do) the most about data is how many incredible information we can get from it. And how much data there is for us to analyze and learn from it.
There's always something new to see and learn in the datasets.

Okay I think it's enough of me for now. You can go ahead and check my projects if you want.

Have a great day!
